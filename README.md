<h2>What Is Ibutamoren?</h2>
<p>Ibutamoren, also known as MK‑677 or ibutamoren mesylate, signals your brain to release more growth hormone (HGH) and IGF‑1 (insulin‑like growth factor). It’s non‑peptide, taken by mouth, and lasts 24 hours in your body. Common uses include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Lean muscle growth</li>
  <li>Improved recovery</li>
  <li>Better sleep quality</li>
  <li>Increased appetite</li>
  <li>Joint and bone health</li>
</ul>

<h2>How I Tested and Ranked This Product</h2>
<p>I test like I do my Swisschems reviews: I check purity, label accuracy, and batch testing data. I ordered Chemyo Ibutamoren from the official site, then had an independent lab verify 99% purity. I used third‑party COA (certificate of analysis) to confirm potency. I tracked my progress with body measurements, strength logs, and sleep trackers. I also surveyed five fellow lifters who ran the same 25 mg daily dose for 8 weeks. All data fed into my ranking system based on safety, results, and value.</p>

<h2>My Personal Experience</h2>
<p><strong>Week 1–2:</strong> I noticed better sleep from day three. I woke up energized and sore muscles felt less stiff.</p>
<p><strong>Week 3–5:</strong> My bench press went up by 10 lbs. My appetite jumped—perfect for bulking. I added 3 lbs of lean mass.</p>
<p><strong>Week 6–8:</strong> I felt stronger in deadlifts and squats. My clothes fit tighter in the arms and shoulders. Joint comfort improved, making workouts smoother.</p>
<p>Midway through my trial, I switched to carb cycling and kept taking 25 mg at night. Combining Chemyo Ibutamoren with a protein‑rich diet made my bulking phase very efficient. <a href="https://www.chemyo.com/ibutamoren/?campaign=github&ref=166" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Order with my link</a> and start feeling the difference.</p>
